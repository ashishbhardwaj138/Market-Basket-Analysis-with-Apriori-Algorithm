# Market-Basket-Analysis-with-Apriori-Algorithm
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings and products that are likely to be purchased together.
Some terminologies to familiarize yourself with Market Basket Analysis are:
Antecedent:Items or 'itemsets' found within the data are antecedents. In simpler words, it's the IF component, written on the left-hand side. In the above example, bread is the antecedent.
Consequent:A consequent is an item or set of items found in combination with the antecedent. It's the THEN component, written on the right-hand side. In the above example, butter is the consequent.

With the help of the Apriori Algorithm, we can further classify and simplify the item sets that the consumer frequently buys. There are three components in APRIORI ALGORITHM:

SUPPORT
CONFIDENCE
LIFT

SUPPORT
It has been calculated with the number of transactions divided by the total number of transactions made.
CONFIDENCE
Whether the product sales are popular on individual sales or through combined sales has been calculated. That is calculated with combined transactions/individual transactions.
LIFT
Lift is calculated for knowing the ratio for the sales.When the Lift value is below 1, the combination is not so frequently bought by consumers. But in this case, it shows that the probability of buying both the things together is high when compared to the transaction for the individual items sold.
